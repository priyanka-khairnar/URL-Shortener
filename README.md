# URL-Shortener
URL shorteners take a long, awkward link and turn it into a shorter, easier to share one. 
For example, you can take something like: https://www.google.com/search?q=url+shortener&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN979IN979&oq=url+shortener&aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0i512l4j69i60l2.2995j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 and turn it into https://rb.gy/wzkhor.

In this way, you can include a memorable, typable link on a business card, print ad, podcast interview, or any other occasion where someone cannot click a hyperlink.
